# Producer Consumer
## Problem statement 
1. There is a buffer which can hold limited messages (fixed capacity)
2. There can be one or more producers
3. There can be one or more consumers
4. Producer must wait to produce if the buffer is full
5. Consumer must wait to consume if the buffer is empty
6. The implementation should handle concurrency control or thread safety
